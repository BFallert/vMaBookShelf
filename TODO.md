## Firefox Add-on vMaBookShelfHelper

In the current version everything is preset for UB Mannheim.
I have to adapt the urls
in Firefox-Add-on/vMaBookShelfHelper/data/js/erzeuge-close-button.js

fixed since 16.03.2015, 13:07:36

The Add-on now has a configuration dialog. Currently you have to configure it.
I planned to use the information in the first webpage to decrease the number of
places where you have to fix the configuration.
