## Firefox Add-on vMaBookShelfHelper

At the moment everythin is for Mannheim. I have to flexibel the urls
in Firefox-Add-on\vMaBookShelfHelper\data\js\erzeuge-close-button.js

fixed since 16.03.2015, 13:07:36

The Add-on has now a configuation dialog, at the moment you have to configure it. I planed to use the information in the first webpage to decrease the places where you have to configure.
